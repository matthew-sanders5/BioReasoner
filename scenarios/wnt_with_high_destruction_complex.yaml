name: wnt_with_high_destruction_complex_conflict
description: >
  Wnt ligand is present and a high destruction complex activity state
  is also asserted, leading to an explicit conflict once Wnt lowers
  the destruction complex via signalosome formation.

  cell_line: "generic_STF_like"
  notes: >
    This scenario is intentionally contradictory: we assert
    DESTRUCTION_COMPLEX__ACTIVITY__HIGH at baseline, then Wnt signaling
    infers DESTRUCTION_COMPLEX__ACTIVITY__LOW via the signalosome.
